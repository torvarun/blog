In a matchup of the old versus the young, the Toronto Raptors played  host to the New Orleans Pelicans to open the 2019-20 NBA season. Fans  were treated to an overtime affair, but first-overall pick Zion  Williamson ‘s injury meant the matchup lacked the jazz many had hoped  for.

The night’s second matchup, the battle of LA, made up for the  star-power the first game lacked. LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, and  Anthony Davis all played their roles in a back-and-forth game, but it  was the Clippers who ultimately came out on top. 

If opening night was any indication, NBA fans are in for one of the most entertaining NBA seasons in recent memory. 

### Ibaka’s stubborn offensive game

With Marc Gasol struggling to start the season, Serge Ibaka has seen a good share of minutes off the bench, especially on the second night of a back-to-back against the Bulls on Saturday. Most of his usage is as the screener in the 1-5 pick and roll, which allows him to either roll to  the basket or pop out. 

After receiving the pass in the pick-and-pop, Ibaka usually sizes up  him man to take the jumper without dribbling. If the shot isn’t there,  he almost always pump fakes before putting the ball on the floor and  trying to drive for a finish at the rim. This works from the midrange,  where is Ibaka is an above-average shooter and defenders often bite on  his pump fakes. Occasionally, however, Ibaka elects to pop out beyond  the arc.

This is where the problems begin.

Ibaka seems to decide the shot he will take very early when he is  behind the arc. He isn’t a great three-point shooter and rarely shoots  the three unless he is left on an island, so his defender (should) know  better than to bite on his pump fake. This leaves Ibaka’s defender  anticipating a drive and in solid position to contest.

Here, Wendell Carter Jr. does exactly that: he refuses to flinch on  the pump fake, stays in front of Ibaka on the drive, and bothers him  enough to force the airball. If Ibaka didn’t have tunnel vision for his  shot at the rim, he might have noticed Powell wide open for three when  Ryan Arcidiacono gambled for the steal, or Terence Davis Jr. under the  hoop for a dump-off pass.

Ibaka’s stubbornness wouldn’t be a problem if he spaced out to the  midrange after setting screens; however, with all of the Raptors’ ball  handlers preferring to drive rather than shoot, don’t be surprised to  see these frustrating plays at least a few times every night.

### The Raptors’ new starters

The departures of Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green meant Nick Nurse  would have to revamp the Raptors’ offence without the team’s most potent isolation scorer and three-point shooter from the season prior.  Together, Leonard and Green combined for 30% of the team’s field goal  attempts (FGA) per game last season, which would have to be distributed  by Nurse this year. 

As expected, Pascal Siakam has seen the largest increase on the team. He now takes the lion’s share of the team’s shots, almost doubling to  24% from 13.2%. Lowry has seen a similar increase as well, attempting 5% more of the team’s field goals than he did a year ago. 

(Interestingly, Lowry has done this with no meaningful change in his  usage rate—while also averaging 6 more points per game. He’s done a good job of taking shots in the rhythm of the offence and getting to the  line more, doubling his free throw attempts from last year.)

So, where have the other half of Leonard and Green’s shots gone? Fred Van Vleet and OG Anunoby have dived them up amongst themselves. 

Van Vleet has been playing like he did in the NBA finals as opposed  to how he did the rest of the playoffs. He’s been aggressive as the pick and roll ball handler, exploiting mismatches, and shooting  aggressively. To some extent, he has taken over for Kawhi’s  ball-handling duties. 

Likewise, Anunoby has taken over for Green as the team’s floor spacer and corner shooter. He rarely handles the ball or has play calls for  him, but patiently waits on the weak side for kick-outs. It has served  him well so far, allowing him to average 12.3 points through the first  three games of the season.

If both Van Vleet and Anunoby can keep this up, the Raptors will be  in good shape this year. The best-case scenario would be Normal Powell  playing himself into favour and receiving more shots since he is the  team’s best isolation threat when Siakam and Lowry are on the bench.  Seeing Gasol receive some low-post touches would be nice as well.

### Ilyasova’s aggressive charge drawing

Last year, Milwaukee’s Ersan Ilyasova led the NBA with 49 charges  drawn. The difference between him and second place Blake Griffin was 19  charges—the same as the difference between Griffin and 28th ranked  DeMarcus Cousins. In fact, over the past three seasons (since the NBA  first made the stat available as part of their [“hustle stats”](https://stats.nba.com/players/hustle/?Season=2018-19&SeasonType=Regular Season&sort=CHARGES_DRAWN&dir=1&PerMode=Totals)), no player has drawn more charges than Ilyasova, who has amassed 117. 

Most players simply avoid drawing charges—who can blame them for  getting out of the way when an NBA player is barrelling down the lane at full speed. Furthermore, the difference between a charge and a blocking foul is razor-thin, but the swing is very large, with the former being  an offensive foul and turnover while the latter usually results in an  and-1 opportunity.

However, the players that do seek out charge drawing opportunities—Ilyasova, Griffin, Lowry, pre-injury DeMarcus Cousins, and [a younger Anthony Tolliver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-player-whos-so-good-at-taking-charges-we-created-a-stat-for-him/)—all do so in an extremely aggressive manner. They rotate early and often  from the weak-side to set up in front of the charge circle, and when  on-ball, shuffle their feet aggressively to beat their man to a spot on  the perimeter.

Ilyasova is perhaps the most aggressive charge-drawer in the NBA  today, and it’s not hard to catch. On the defensive possession after a  score against Houston, Ilyasova set up three times to draw a charge in  the span of 8 seconds—all without surrendering an advantage to the  offensive. First, he stops Harden in his tracks at the foul line, then  he stymies Gordon’s isolation attempt on the perimeter, before finally  cutting off McLemore at the elbow. 

Ilyasova didn’t draw a charge on the possession, but his  aggressiveness (and reputation) forced the offensive to think twice  about taking another step towards the basket. Unfortunately, Ilyasova  committed a blocking foul the next time around trying to do the very  same thing.
